<h2> internet backbone is the code behind the internet that holds it together and runs websites like google and youtube. A client is a workstation that can obtain information and aplications from the server. a server allows you to store information on a server for use later. servers keep information, routers give access to the internet for interaction with other computers and servers, a switch allows two different computers to communicate with each other. websites, videogames and streaming platforms all use client and server relationships. a text that contains a link to another text. the web holds every website. client and server interaction using HTTP is facilitated by using hypertexts to easily go to different websites. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP and HTTP is the way the www is loaded. (typically using hypertext). The development of the web first started with version 1, where you could only "read" the web, version 2 was the "social web", when people and computers could start comunicating with each other, and version 3 allowed for read and write on the web. markup languages are pretty much different clients communicating code in a different way.
    markup languages are used to structure and format text and other content on a webpage. scripting languages are used to automate tasks and add functionality to applications. SGML is the standard version of all markup languages. HTML allows you to embed images and the structure of browsers. XML is another markup language that allows easy defining, storing and sharing of data. </h2>
